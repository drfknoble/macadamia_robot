## Introduction

Welcome to my repository for my Macadamia Nut Harvesting Robot project.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised as follows:

```console

```

All Computer Aided Design (CAD) files can be found in the `/cad` sub-directory. The `/fabrication` sub-directory contains all the files necessary to build the mechanical aspects of the project.  

All Electronic Design Autonatuib (EDA) files can be found in the `/eda` sub-directory. The `/fabrication` sub-directory contains all the files necessary to build the electrical aspects of the project.  

All source code and software libaries can be found in the `/src` sub-directory. The `/releases` sub-directory contains all the binaries that need to be installed.  

Documentation and additional media is included in the `/doc` sub-directory.
